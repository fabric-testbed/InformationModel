# FIM layout

Some basic helper classes at the top. 

- [graph](graph/README.md) - property graph abstractions/implementations
- [slivers](slivers/README.md) - `sliver`-based implementations of structures to hold information about individually
provisionable resources. Use inside CF code, but also as a quasi-schema for properties associated with different
resources in property graphs
- [user](user/README.md) - user-facing higher-level abstractions (ExperimentTopology, etc) that make it easy for end-users
to generate and operate on property graph models
